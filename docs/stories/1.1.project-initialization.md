# Story 1.1: Project Initialization & Repository Setup

## Status

Approved

## Story

**As a** Developer,
**I want** a new project initialized with the chosen framework and a corresponding Git repository,
**so that** I have a clean foundation to start building on.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. A new project is created using the Architect's chosen framework (e.g., `npx create-next-app`).
2. A new Git repository is initialized.
3. The initial project files are committed to the `main` branch.
4. A `.gitignore` file is configured with appropriate defaults for the chosen framework.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Initialize Next.js project with TypeScript (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Run `npx create-next-app@latest` with TypeScript configuration
  - [ ] Verify project structure matches unified project structure from architecture
  - [ ] Install additional dependencies per tech stack (shadcn/ui, Tailwind CSS, Vitest, Cypress)
- [ ] Initialize Git repository (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Run `git init` in project root
  - [ ] Configure initial Git settings if needed
- [ ] Configure .gitignore file (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Ensure .gitignore includes Next.js defaults
  - [ ] Add OS-specific ignores (.DS_Store, IDE files)
  - [ ] Add environment variables (.env files)
- [ ] Create initial commit (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Stage all initial project files
  - [ ] Create initial commit with descriptive message
  - [ ] Ensure commit is on `main` branch
- [ ] Verify project setup
  - [ ] Run `pnpm dev` to ensure development server works
  - [ ] Run `pnpm build` to ensure project builds successfully
  - [ ] Run initial tests to verify testing setup

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

No previous stories - this is the first story of the project.

### Framework and Technology Details

**Next.js Framework:** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

- Next.js ~14.2 with TypeScript ~5.4
- React ~18.2 as UI library
- Use `npx create-next-app` for initialization

**Package Manager:** [Source: architecture/development-workflow.md]

- Use `pnpm` as the package manager
- Standard scripts: `pnpm dev`, `pnpm build`, `pnpm test`

**Project Structure:** [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
Expected structure after initialization:

```text
miovox-com/
├── .github/
├── /docs
├── /public
├── /src
│   ├── /app
│   ├── /components
│   │   ├── /ui
│   │   ├── /shared
│   │   └── /features
│   ├── /data
│   └── /styles
├── .env.example
├── .eslintrc.json
├── next.config.mjs
├── package.json
├── tailwind.config.ts
└── tsconfig.json
```

**Core Dependencies to Install:** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

- shadcn/ui (Latest) - Headless component library
- Tailwind CSS ~3.4 - Utility-first CSS framework
- Vitest ~1.5 - Unit/Integration testing
- Cypress ~13.7 - E2E testing

**Deployment Platform:** [Source: architecture/deployment-architecture.md]

- Vercel will be used for hosting
- Git-based "push-to-deploy" strategy
- Main branch auto-deploys to production

### File Locations

All files should be created in the project root following Next.js conventions and the unified project structure.

### Technical Constraints

**Coding Standards:** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]

- Strict TypeScript with no `any` types
- Centralized data access
- Styling exclusively with Tailwind CSS
- Safe environment variable handling

**Git Workflow:** [Source: architecture/deployment-architecture.md]

- Use `main` branch as primary branch
- All commits should be ready for deployment

### Testing

**Testing Framework:** [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]

- Vitest and React Testing Library for Unit/Integration tests
- Cypress for End-to-End tests
- Follow Testing Pyramid strategy

**Test Setup Requirements:**

- Ensure Vitest is configured during project setup
- Verify test scripts are available in package.json
- Initial smoke tests should pass after setup
