# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision

The overall UX vision is to create a clean, professional, and modern digital presence that instills confidence and credibility. The site should feel like a high-end, bespoke studio. Navigation should be effortless, and the brand's three pillars must be communicated with absolute clarity. The site itself should serve as a testament to quality craftsmanship. _A primary UX challenge will be to present the three distinct services in a way that allows a visitor to immediately self-segment and dive into their area of interest, without feeling that the other services dilute the expertise in their chosen area._

## Key Interaction Paradigms (revised)

The homepage will function as a **Brand Portal**. Its primary goal is to allow users to immediately self-segment and navigate to one of three distinct sub-sections (or 'sub-sites'). Once within a sub-section, the primary navigation and content will focus exclusively on that service line, minimizing the presence of the other two services to maintain a strong sense of specialized expertise.

## Core Screens and Views

- A **Homepage / Landing Page** that introduces Miovox Studio and directs users to the three pillars.
- Three distinct **Service Pages** (for AI, Home Tech, and Events).
- A **Portfolio / Project Detail Page** template to showcase work within each service.
- A simple **About / Contact Page**.

## Accessibility: WCAG AA

The site will adhere to WCAG AA standards, ensuring it is accessible to a wide range of users.

## Branding

Branding should be minimalist and premium. A key design goal is to emulate an "Apple-style" aesthetic, using a mix of light-themed and dark-themed sections to create visual interest and delineate content areas. The overall feel should be clean and sophisticated.

## Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive

The website will be fully responsive, designed with a mobile-first approach to ensure a seamless experience on all devices, from phones to desktops.
