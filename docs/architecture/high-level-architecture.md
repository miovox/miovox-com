# High Level Architecture

## Technical Summary

The architecture for Miovox Studio will be a modern, serverless Jamstack application. It will be built using a Next.js frontend, deployed statically for maximum performance and minimal cost. The system is designed with a "progressive complexity" approach; while the MVP is a static site, the foundation is laid for future expansion with serverless functions for features like a blog or contact form. This design directly supports the PRD goals of speed, low cost, and serving as a high-quality portfolio piece.

## Platform and Infrastructure Choice

- **Platform:** Vercel
- **Key Services:** Vercel's Global CDN for static hosting, and Vercel Functions for any future serverless API needs.
- **Deployment Regions:** Vercel's global edge network.
- **Rationale:** Vercel is the ideal platform as it's built by the creators of Next.js, offering a seamless and highly optimized deployment experience. Its free tier is generous and perfectly aligns with the project's budget constraints.

## Repository Structure

- **Structure:** Single Repository (Polyrepo).
- **Monorepo Tool:** N/A for the MVP.
- **Package Organization:** Standard Next.js project structure, as generated by `create-t3-app`.

## High Level Project Diagram

## Architectural and Design Patterns

- **Jamstack Architecture:** The frontend is pre-built into highly optimized static assets and served from a CDN. Dynamic functionality is handled by client-side JavaScript. **Rationale:** This provides optimal performance, higher security, and lower cost of scaling.
- **Static Site Generation (SSG):** Pages are generated at build time, not on a server for each request. **Rationale:** Ensures the fastest possible page loads for visitors.
- **Component-Based UI:** The user interface will be built as a series of reusable components in React. **Rationale:** Promotes maintainability, reusability, and a clean codebase.
