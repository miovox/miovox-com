# Development Workflow

The workflow will use `pnpm` as the package manager. Standard scripts (`pnpm dev`, `pnpm build`, `pnpm test`) will be used. The T3 starter provides a pre-configured, best-practice environment for linting, formatting, and TypeScript compilation. We will add environment variable validation with Zod and recommend key VS Code extensions.
