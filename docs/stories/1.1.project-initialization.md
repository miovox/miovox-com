# Story 1.1: Project Initialization & Repository Setup

## Status

Done

## Story

**As a** Developer,
**I want** a new project initialized with the chosen framework and a corresponding Git repository,
**so that** I have a clean foundation to start building on.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. A new project is created using the Architect's chosen framework (e.g., `npx create-next-app`).
2. A new Git repository is initialized.
3. The initial project files are committed to the `main` branch.
4. A `.gitignore` file is configured with appropriate defaults for the chosen framework.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Initialize Next.js project with TypeScript (AC: 1)
  - [x] Run `npx create-next-app@latest` with TypeScript configuration
  - [x] Verify project structure matches unified project structure from architecture
  - [x] Install additional dependencies per tech stack (shadcn/ui, Tailwind CSS, Vitest, Cypress)
- [x] Initialize Git repository (AC: 2)
  - [x] Run `git init` in project root
  - [x] Configure initial Git settings if needed
- [x] Configure .gitignore file (AC: 4)
  - [x] Ensure .gitignore includes Next.js defaults
  - [x] Add OS-specific ignores (.DS_Store, IDE files)
  - [x] Add environment variables (.env files)
- [x] Create initial commit (AC: 3)
  - [x] Stage all initial project files
  - [x] Create initial commit with descriptive message
  - [x] Ensure commit is on `main` branch
- [x] Verify project setup
  - [x] Run `pnpm dev` to ensure development server works
  - [x] Run `pnpm build` to ensure project builds successfully
  - [x] Run initial tests to verify testing setup

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

No previous stories - this is the first story of the project.

### Framework and Technology Details

**Next.js Framework:** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

- Next.js ~14.2 with TypeScript ~5.4
- React ~18.2 as UI library
- Use `npx create-next-app` for initialization

**Package Manager:** [Source: architecture/development-workflow.md]

- Use `pnpm` as the package manager
- Standard scripts: `pnpm dev`, `pnpm build`, `pnpm test`

**Project Structure:** [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
Expected structure after initialization:

```text
miovox-com/
├── .github/
├── /docs
├── /public
├── /src
│   ├── /app
│   ├── /components
│   │   ├── /ui

│   ├── /data
│   └── /styles
├── .env.example
├── .eslintrc.json
├── next.config.mjs
├── package.json
├── tailwind.config.ts
└── tsconfig.json
```

**Core Dependencies to Install:** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

- shadcn/ui (Latest) - Headless component library
- Tailwind CSS ~3.4 - Utility-first CSS framework
- Vitest ~1.5 - Unit/Integration testing
- Cypress ~13.7 - E2E testing

**Deployment Platform:** [Source: architecture/deployment-architecture.md]

- Vercel will be used for hosting
- Git-based "push-to-deploy" strategy
- Main branch auto-deploys to production

### File Locations

All files should be created in the project root following Next.js conventions and the unified project structure.

### Technical Constraints

**Coding Standards:** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]

- Strict TypeScript with no `any` types
- Centralized data access
- Styling exclusively with Tailwind CSS
- Safe environment variable handling

**Git Workflow:** [Source: architecture/deployment-architecture.md]

- Use `main` branch as primary branch
- All commits should be ready for deployment

### Testing

**Testing Framework:** [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]

- Vitest and React Testing Library for Unit/Integration tests
- Cypress for End-to-End tests
- Follow Testing Pyramid strategy

**Test Setup Requirements:**

- Ensure Vitest is configured during project setup
- Verify test scripts are available in package.json
- Initial smoke tests should pass after setup

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-08-04

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment

The implementation is excellent for a project initialization story. All core requirements have been met with proper Next.js 14.2 setup, TypeScript configuration, and comprehensive tooling. The code follows clean architecture patterns and demonstrates good understanding of modern React/Next.js practices.

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: `src/app/layout.test.tsx`
  - **Change**: Added comprehensive unit tests for RootLayout component
  - **Why**: Improve test coverage for critical layout component that wasn't previously tested
  - **How**: Tests verify children rendering, font application, and metadata correctness

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ All standards met - strict TypeScript, Tailwind CSS exclusively, proper structure
- Project Structure: ✓ Matches unified project structure perfectly with all required directories
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Vitest configured correctly with Testing Library, basic tests passing
- All ACs Met: ✓ All acceptance criteria fully implemented and verified

### Improvements Checklist

- [x] Added missing layout component tests (src/app/layout.test.tsx)
- [x] Verified all configuration files are properly set up
- [x] Confirmed build and test processes work correctly
- [x] Validated project structure matches architectural requirements

### Security Review

No security concerns identified. Environment variable handling is properly configured with .env files in .gitignore and .env.example template ready for use.

### Performance Considerations

Next.js configuration is optimized with proper static generation. Tailwind CSS is configured efficiently. No performance issues identified for initial setup.

### Final Status

✓ Approved - Ready for Done

**Notes**: This is a high-quality project initialization that exceeds the basic requirements. The developer has created a solid foundation with excellent tooling setup, comprehensive .gitignore, and proper architectural structure. Environmental warnings (nvm and Vite CJS deprecation) are non-critical and don't affect functionality.
