# Introduction

This document outlines the complete fullstack architecture for Miovox Studio, including backend systems, frontend implementation, and their integration. It serves as the single source of truth for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency across the entire technology stack. This unified approach combines what would traditionally be separate backend and frontend architecture documents, streamlining the development process for modern fullstack applications where these concerns are increasingly intertwined.

## Starter Template or Existing Project

We will use the **"T3 Stack" (`create-t3-app`)** installer to generate the project foundation. Critically, we will **de-select the optional backend components** (Prisma, tRPC, NextAuth) to ensure the MVP is lightweight and "right-sized" for a static site, while establishing a clear path for future scalability.
