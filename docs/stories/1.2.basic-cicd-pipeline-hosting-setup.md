# Story 1.2: Basic CI/CD Pipeline & Hosting Setup

## Status

Approved

## Story

**As the** Owner,
**I want** a basic CI/CD pipeline connected to the repository and a hosting provider,
**so that** any push to the main branch is automatically deployed and the site is live.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. A new project is created on the chosen hosting provider (e.g., Vercel, Netlify).
2. The hosting project is linked to the Git repository.
3. The CI/CD pipeline automatically deploys the `main` branch on every push.
4. The default page of the new project is publicly accessible at its provided URL.
5. The setup adheres to the free-tier constraints of the provider (NFR1).

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Create Vercel project and link to repository (AC: 1, 2)
  - [ ] Sign up/log in to Vercel account
  - [ ] Import project from Git repository
  - [ ] Configure project settings for Next.js
  - [ ] Verify repository connection and permissions
- [ ] Configure automatic deployment pipeline (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Ensure main branch is set as production branch
  - [ ] Verify deployment triggers on push to main
  - [ ] Test deployment pipeline with a sample commit
- [ ] Verify public accessibility (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Confirm site is accessible at provided Vercel URL
  - [ ] Test that default Next.js page loads correctly
  - [ ] Verify responsive behavior on different devices
- [ ] Validate free-tier compliance (AC: 5)
  - [ ] Confirm project stays within Vercel free-tier limits
  - [ ] Document any relevant free-tier constraints for future reference
- [ ] Configure environment and deployment settings
  - [ ] Set up environment variables if needed (.env handling)
  - [ ] Configure build and output settings per Next.js requirements
  - [ ] Verify build process completes successfully on Vercel

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

From Story 1.1 completion:

- Next.js 14.2 project with TypeScript successfully initialized
- Project structure follows unified project structure requirements
- All dependencies (shadcn/ui, Tailwind CSS, Vitest, Cypress) are installed
- Build process (`pnpm build`) and development server (`pnpm dev`) confirmed working
- Git repository is initialized with proper .gitignore configuration

### Deployment Platform Details

**Hosting Provider:** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

- Vercel is the chosen CI/CD & Hosting platform
- Provides seamless Git-based workflow and generous free tier
- Aligns with Next.js optimization and serverless functions for future expansion

**Deployment Strategy:** [Source: architecture/deployment-architecture.md]

- Git-based, "push-to-deploy" strategy
- Pushes to any branch create unique Preview URLs
- Merges to `main` branch automatically deploy to production
- Main branch serves as primary deployment branch

### Technical Configuration Requirements

**Build Configuration:** [Source: architecture/development-workflow.md]

- Use `pnpm` as package manager (already configured in Story 1.1)
- Standard scripts: `pnpm dev`, `pnpm build`, `pnpm test` (already available)
- Next.js project should build without additional configuration

**Environment Variables:** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]

- Safe environment variable handling required
- .env.example template already created in Story 1.1
- Vercel will need environment variables configured if any are required

### Project Structure Alignment

**Repository Structure:** [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]

- Current project structure matches expected layout
- Next.js configuration files (next.config.mjs, package.json) already in place
- No structural conflicts expected with Vercel deployment

### File Locations

All configuration will be handled through Vercel's web interface and automatic detection of Next.js project structure. No additional files need to be created in the repository for basic deployment.

### Technical Constraints

**Free-Tier Compliance:** [Source: epic requirements NFR1]

- Must adhere to Vercel's free-tier constraints
- Generous free tier should accommodate MVP needs
- Monitor usage to stay within limits

**Performance Requirements:** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]

- Strict TypeScript compilation must pass on Vercel build
- Build process should complete successfully with current project setup

### Testing

**Testing Framework:** [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]

- Vitest and React Testing Library for Unit/Integration tests (already configured)
- Cypress for End-to-End tests (already configured)
- Tests should continue to pass in Vercel build environment

**Deployment Verification:**

- Verify all existing tests pass during Vercel build process
- Confirm build completes without errors
- Test that deployed site functions correctly
