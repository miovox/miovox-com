## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

From Story 1.2 completion:

- Next.js 14.2 project successfully deployed to Vercel at https://miovox-com.vercel.app/
- Build process working with TypeScript strict mode and all linting
- pnpm package manager properly configured
- CI/CD pipeline automatically deploys main branch changes
- Custom landing page already exists but needs to be replaced with proper homepage

### Architecture Foundation

**Framework and Language:** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

- Styling exclusively with Tailwind CSS ~3.4 utility classes

**Component Architecture:** [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md]

- Functional components using React and TypeScript
- Standard `/src` layout with `/app` (routes), `/components` (ui, shared, features), `/data`, `/styles`
- State management with built-in React Hooks (useState, useContext)
- All internal navigation uses Next.js `<Link>` component for client-side routing

### Component Specifications

**Layout Components:** [Source: architecture/components.md]

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-08-04

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Excellent Implementation** - The homepage implementation demonstrates high-quality code with proper architecture, clean component structure, and adherence to modern React/Next.js patterns. The developer successfully translated the V0 specification into a production-ready implementation that meets all acceptance criteria.

Key strengths:

- Clean, functional component architecture using TypeScript strict mode
- Proper separation of concerns with logical component hierarchy
- Excellent responsive design implementation with mobile-first approach
- Consistent styling using Tailwind CSS exclusively
- Good accessibility considerations (semantic HTML, proper alt text)
- Comprehensive test coverage for all major functionality

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: `/src/components/sections/Footer.tsx`
  - **Change**: Replaced HTML `<a>` tags with Next.js `<Link>` components for internal navigation
  - **Why**: Dev Notes specifically require "All internal navigation uses Next.js `<Link>` component for client-side routing"
  - **How**: This improves performance by enabling client-side navigation and follows Next.js best practices for internal linking

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ Strict TypeScript with no `any` types, Tailwind CSS exclusively, proper component structure
- Project Structure: ✓ All files placed in correct directories according to unified project structure
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Comprehensive unit tests using Vitest and React Testing Library
- All ACs Met: ✓ All acceptance criteria fully implemented and verified

### Improvements Checklist

- [x] Fixed Footer component to use Next.js Link for internal navigation (`/src/components/sections/Footer.tsx`)
- [x] Verified all tests pass after refactoring
- [x] Confirmed build process works without errors
- [x] Validated responsive design across all breakpoints
- [x] Verified TypeScript strict mode compliance

### Security Review

**No security concerns identified** - The implementation follows secure practices:

- No sensitive data exposure
- Safe use of Next.js Image component with proper alt attributes
- No unsafe HTML injection or dynamic content rendering
- Proper TypeScript typing prevents common runtime errors

### Performance Considerations

**Well optimized for performance**:

- Next.js Image component used with `priority` flag for hero logo
- Static generation enabled for homepage
- Proper CSS class structure for efficient styling
- Minimal JavaScript bundle size
- Clean component hierarchy without unnecessary re-renders

### Final Status

**✓ Approved - Ready for Done**

The implementation is production-ready and exceeds expectations. All acceptance criteria are met, the code follows best practices, tests are comprehensive, and the single architectural issue (Footer navigation) has been resolved. The homepage successfully presents the Miovox Studio brand with a premium, minimalist design that effectively showcases the three core services.
