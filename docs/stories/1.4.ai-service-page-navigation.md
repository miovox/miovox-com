## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

From Story 1.3 completion:

- Homepage implemented with BrandPortal component containing three service cards
- All navigation currently uses placeholder links (need to update AI service card)
- MainLayout component established and working properly
- Responsive design patterns established with mobile-first approach
- Testing framework (Vitest + React Testing Library) configured and operational

### Architecture Foundation

**Framework and Language:** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

- Next.js ~14.2 with App Router for file-system based routing
- TypeScript ~5.4 with strict typing (no `any` types allowed)
- React ~18.2 functional components with hooks for state management
- Styling exclusively with Tailwind CSS ~3.4 utility classes

**Component Architecture:** [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md]

- Functional components using React and TypeScript
- Standard `/src` layout with `/app` (routes), `/components` (ui, shared, features), `/data`, `/styles`
- State management with built-in React Hooks (useState, useContext)
- All internal navigation uses Next.js `<Link>` component for client-side routing

### File Locations

**Project Structure:** [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]

- New AI service page: `/src/app/product/page.tsx` (Next.js App Router convention)
- Layout components: `/src/components/ui/` (MainLayout, Container)
- Shared components: `/src/components/shared/` (Header, Footer)
- Feature components: `/src/components/features/` (BrandPortal - needs update)
- Test files: Located alongside components or in same directory as pages

### Component Specifications

**Layout Components:** [Source: architecture/components.md]

- **MainLayout**: Top-level page wrapper including Header and Footer (already implemented)
- **Container**: Enforces max-width and consistent padding for all page content (already implemented)

**Navigation Integration:**

- Update BrandPortal component's AI Product Development card to use Next.js Link
- Maintain existing card styling and hover effects while adding proper navigation
- Follow established pattern from Story 1.3 for consistent link implementation

### Routing Requirements

**Next.js App Router:** [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md]

- URLs defined by file system structure
- `/product` route requires `/src/app/product/page.tsx` file
- All internal navigation must use Next.js `<Link>` component for client-side routing
- Page components should export default React functional component

### Technical Constraints

**Coding Standards:** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]

- Strict TypeScript with no `any` types
- Styling exclusively with Tailwind CSS
- Safe environment variable handling
- Centralized data access

**Performance:** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

- Next.js SSG optimizations for static pages
- Mobile-first responsive design approach
- Clean, minimal code structure

### Data Requirements

**Content Strategy:** [Source: architecture/data-models.md]

- For MVP, static placeholder content in page component
- Service description content should be structured for future CMS integration
- No specific data models required for initial placeholder implementation

### Testing Requirements

**Testing Strategy:** [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]

- Unit/Integration tests using Vitest ~1.5 and React Testing Library
- Test files located alongside components or in same directory
- Focus on component rendering, functionality, and responsive behavior
- Testing Pyramid approach with solid unit test foundation

**Specific Test Cases:**

- Page component renders without errors
- Service title and placeholder content display correctly
- MainLayout integration works properly
- Responsive design functions across breakpoints
- Navigation links work correctly from homepage
- Accessibility standards are met

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-08-04

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment

The implementation successfully meets all acceptance criteria with solid code quality. The developer followed Next.js App Router conventions correctly and implemented proper TypeScript patterns. The BrandPortal navigation update is clean and the new product page follows established architectural patterns.

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: `/src/app/product/page.tsx`
  - **Change**: Improved semantic HTML structure using `<article>`, `<header>`, `<section>`, and `<aside>` elements
  - **Why**: Better accessibility, SEO, and semantic meaning for screen readers and search engines
  - **How**: Replaced generic `<div>` elements with semantic HTML5 elements while maintaining all existing styling

- **File**: `/src/app/product/page.test.tsx`
  - **Change**: Updated tests to account for semantic HTML changes and improved test assertions
  - **Why**: Tests needed to reflect the new DOM structure and validate semantic elements
  - **How**: Modified queries to test for proper semantic structure and role attributes

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ All TypeScript strict typing followed, Tailwind CSS used exclusively
- Project Structure: ✓ Next.js App Router convention followed perfectly
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Comprehensive unit tests with meaningful assertions
- All ACs Met: ✓ Navigation link functional, page created with proper layout integration, responsive design implemented

### Improvements Checklist

- [x] Enhanced semantic HTML structure for better accessibility (src/app/product/page.tsx)
- [x] Updated test suite to validate semantic structure (src/app/product/page.test.tsx)
- [x] Verified proper heading hierarchy (h1 -> h2 for coming soon section)
- [x] Added role="doc-subtitle" for better screen reader support
- [x] Validated responsive design across breakpoints
- [x] Confirmed SEO metadata implementation

### Security Review

No security concerns identified. The implementation uses Next.js Link components properly for client-side navigation and follows secure coding practices.

### Performance Considerations

Excellent performance characteristics:
- Static page generation (SSG) working correctly
- No unnecessary client-side JavaScript
- Efficient CSS with Tailwind utility classes
- Proper image optimization maintained from MainLayout

### Final Status

✓ Approved - Ready for Done
