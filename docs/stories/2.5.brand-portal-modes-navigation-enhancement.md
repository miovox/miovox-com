## Story 2.5.1: Icon Component System & Asset Integration

### Story Summary
**As a developer, I want theme-aware ServiceIcon component with all service variants so that the Service navigation system can seamlessly integrate with the existing theme switching functionality.**

### Acceptance Criteria

#### AC1: ServiceIcon Component Creation
```gherkin
Given I am implementing the icon system
When I create the ServiceIcon component
Then it should:
- Accept size prop (small: 16px, medium: 24px, large: 32px, xlarge: 48px, xxlarge: 64px)
- Support all service variants (products, events, home-tech, about)
- Use Next.js Image component for optimization
- Handle loading states gracefully
- Include proper alt text for accessibility
- Export TypeScript interfaces for props
```

#### AC2: ServiceIcon About Variant
```gherkin
Given I am implementing the about service icon
When I create the about variant of ServiceIcon
Then it should:
- Optimize philip.png to under 100KB file size
- Accept size prop matching other ServiceIcon variants
- Use Next.js Image component with proper priority settings
- Include proper alt text ("Philip" or "About Philip")
- Handle loading and error states
- Maintain aspect ratio across all sizes
```

#### AC3: Theme Integration
```gherkin
Given ServiceIcon component is created with all variants
When the user switches between light/dark/system themes
Then the component should:
- Update icons immediately without flickering
- Use the same theme detection logic as existing Header.tsx
- Include fallback behavior during hydration
- Maintain visual consistency with existing theme system
```

#### AC4: Component Architecture
```gherkin
Given I am creating the ServiceIcon component
When I structure the component
Then it should:
- Follow existing project TypeScript patterns
- Include proper error boundaries
- Use consistent prop interfaces
- Be located in appropriate directory structure (src/components/ui/)
- Export both default and named exports
- Include JSDoc documentation
```

## Story 2.5.2: Homepage Layout Restructure

### Story Summary
**As a website visitor, I want the homepage to display service navigation as a 4-tile grid in the bottom section so that I can quickly access different areas of the site without needing to scroll.**

### Acceptance Criteria

#### AC1: Layout Restructure
```gherkin
Given I am visiting the homepage
When the page loads on desktop (≥1025px)
Then I should see:
- Hero section (logo + tagline) occupying top 70% of viewport
- 4-tile navigation grid occupying bottom 30% of viewport (30vh)
- No scroll required to see all content on standard desktop screens (1920x1080, 1440x900)
- Grid arranged as 2×2 layout with equal spacing
- Each tile taking exactly 25% of viewport width
```

#### AC2: ServiceNavigation Component - Homepage Variant
```gherkin
Given the ServiceNavigation component is implemented
When rendered in 'homepage' variant
Then each tile should display:
- Appropriate ServiceIcon (products/events/home-tech icons with theme variants, philip icon for About)
- Service name as primary text (Products, Events, Home Tech, About)
- Tagline as secondary text (Crafting Tools, Crafting Memories, Crafting Lifestyles, Philip Jones)
- Background color following existing Brand Portal gradient system
- Smooth hover transitions with scale effect and background intensity change
```

#### AC3: Responsive Behavior
```gherkin
Given I am viewing the homepage on different screen sizes
When the viewport changes
Then the layout should adapt:

Desktop (≥1025px):
- 2×2 grid, 30vh height, full text labels

Tablet (641px-1024px):  
- 2×2 grid, 35vh height, responsive text sizing
- Touch-friendly tile sizes (minimum 44px touch targets)

Mobile (≤640px):
- Alternative layout: vertical stack or compressed 2×2
- 40vh height to accommodate smaller screens
- Larger typography for readability
- Maintain tile aspect ratios
```

#### AC4: Hero Section Modifications
```gherkin
Given the Hero component needs to work with new layout
When Hero.tsx is updated
Then it should:
- Remove all scroll-dependent animations and behaviors
- Center logo and tagline vertically within its 70vh container
- Maintain existing logo sizing and typography
- Remove the animated down arrow and "Studios" text
- Keep the dark background theme
- Ensure content doesn't overflow into navigation grid area
```

#### AC5: Navigation Integration
```gherkin
Given each navigation tile is clickable
When I click on a tile
Then it should:
- Navigate to correct route (Products → /product, Events → /events, Home Tech → /home, About → /about)
- Maintain existing page functionality after navigation
- Provide visual feedback during hover and click states
- Support keyboard navigation for accessibility
- Include proper ARIA labels and roles

## Story 2.5.3: Header Mode Switcher & About Page

### Story Summary
**As a website visitor navigating subpages, I want a compact Service switcher in the header alongside the theme toggle so that I can switch between site sections without returning to the homepage, plus access a personal About page that reflects Philip's individual brand.**

### Acceptance Criteria

#### AC1: Header Service Switcher Implementation
```gherkin
Given I am viewing any subpage (/product, /events, /home, /about)
When I look at the header
Then I should see:
- Existing Miovox logo on the left (unchanged)
- Service switcher component positioned next to the theme toggle on the right
- Four service options displayed as: icon + text label
- Current page service highlighted/active state
- Consistent visual language matching the existing ThemeToggle component
```

#### AC2: Service Switcher Visual Design
```gherkin
Given the header service switcher is displayed
When I examine its visual design
Then it should:
- Use ServiceIcon with theme-aware icons for Products, Events, Home Tech services
- Use ServiceIcon with about icon for About service
- Display text labels: "Products", "Events", "Home Tech", "About"
- Match ThemeToggle's button group styling and spacing
- Include hover states consistent with theme toggle behavior
- Adapt to different screen sizes (icon-only on mobile if needed)
```

#### AC3: Header Layout & Responsive Behavior
```gherkin
Given the header needs to accommodate both theme toggle and service switcher
When the header renders across different screen sizes
Then it should:

Desktop (≥1025px):
- Show full service switcher with icon + text labels
- Maintain adequate spacing between logo, service switcher, and theme toggle

Tablet (641px-1024px):
- Show abbreviated labels or icon + shortened text
- Maintain touch-friendly spacing

Mobile (≤640px):
- Consider icon-only service switcher or collapsible menu
- Ensure touch targets remain ≥44px
- May stack elements vertically if needed
```

#### AC4: About Page Creation
```gherkin
Given I need to create the About page
When I navigate to /about
Then I should see:
- MainLayout with header (including service switcher)
- Personal content with "It's This Guy" theme/approach
- ServiceIcon about variant prominently displayed
- Content that reflects personal branding vs corporate messaging
- Consistent styling with other site pages
- Proper SEO metadata and page title
```

#### AC5: Navigation State Management
```gherkin
Given I am using the service switcher for navigation
When I click on different services
Then the system should:
- Navigate to the correct route immediately
- Update active/highlighted state to show current page
- Maintain smooth transitions without page flash
- Preserve existing page functionality after navigation
- Handle browser back/forward navigation correctly
- Update document title and meta description appropriately

## Architecture Foundation

### Framework and Language
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

- Next.js ~14.2 with App Router for file-system based routing
- TypeScript ~5.4 with strict typing (no `any` types allowed)
- React ~18.2 functional components with hooks for state management
- Styling exclusively with Tailwind CSS ~3.4 utility classes

### Component Architecture
[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md]

- Functional components using React and TypeScript
- Standard `/src` layout with `/app` (routes), `/components` (ui, features), `/data`, `/styles`
- State management with built-in React Hooks (useState, useContext, useTheme)
- Theme system integration with next-themes

### Asset Management
```
/public/icons/
├── products-dark.svg - Products service icon dark variant
├── products-light.svg - Products service icon light variant
├── events-dark.svg - Events service icon dark variant
├── events-light.svg - Events service icon light variant
├── home-tech-dark.svg - Home Tech service icon dark variant
├── home-tech-light.svg - Home Tech service icon light variant
└── philip.png (~1MB, needs optimization <100KB) - Personal icon

/public/
├── Miovox-dark-transparent.png (existing) - Full logo dark
└── Miovox-light-transparent.png (existing) - Full logo light
```

## Technical Constraints

### Coding Standards
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]

- Strict TypeScript with no `any` types
- Styling exclusively with Tailwind CSS
- Centralized data access patterns
- Safe environment variable handling

### Compatibility Requirements

- [x] **Existing APIs remain unchanged**: All current routing (/product, /home, /events) preserved
- [x] **UI changes follow existing patterns**: Extends theme system, matches component architecture
- [x] **Performance impact minimal**: Asset optimization planned, no additional requests
- [x] **Backward compatibility**: All existing functionality maintained

### State Management
[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md]

- Use built-in React Hooks (useState, useTheme, usePathname) only
- Maintain simplicity for brownfield enhancement scope
- No external state management libraries required

## Testing Requirements

### Testing Strategy
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]

- Unit/Integration tests using Vitest ~1.5 and React Testing Library
- Test files located alongside components and pages
- Focus on component rendering, functionality, and responsive behavior
- Testing Pyramid approach with solid unit test foundation

### Specific Test Cases

#### Story 2.5.1 Tests
- ServiceIcon component renders correctly for all service variants
- All size variants work as expected (small to xxlarge)
- Theme switching behavior functions without flicker for theme-aware variants
- Asset loading and optimization work correctly
- Accessibility attributes present and functional

#### Story 2.5.2 Tests
- Homepage layout renders without scroll on desktop
- 4-tile grid displays correctly across breakpoints
- Navigation from tiles works to all routes
- Hero section centers properly without scroll behavior
- Responsive design maintains usability

#### Story 2.5.3 Tests
- Header integrates service switcher without layout issues
- Active state reflects current page correctly
- About page renders with proper content and styling
- Service navigation works from all starting pages
- Cross-browser compatibility maintained

## Risk Mitigation

### Primary Risks & Mitigation Strategies

1. **Risk**: Breaking existing theme switching during header integration
   - **Mitigation**: Implement ServiceNavigation as separate component, test theme switching thoroughly
   - **Rollback**: Revert Header.tsx and remove ServiceNavigation component

2. **Risk**: Homepage layout breaking on edge case screen sizes
   - **Mitigation**: Test wide range of viewport dimensions, use CSS clamp() for flexible sizing
   - **Rollback**: Restore original BrandPortal.tsx and page.tsx from git

3. **Risk**: Service switcher making header too cluttered
   - **Mitigation**: Careful spacing design, responsive menu for smaller screens
   - **Rollback**: Remove service switcher, maintain theme toggle only

### Rollback Strategy

All changes are **component-isolated** and **git-reversible**:
- **Story 2.5.1**: Remove icon components, use existing placeholders
- **Story 2.5.2**: Restore BrandPortal.tsx and original page.tsx
- **Story 2.5.3**: Remove ServiceNavigation from Header.tsx, delete About route

## Success Criteria

### Epic-Level Success Metrics

1. **User Experience**: No-scroll homepage navigation, persistent header access
2. **Performance**: Page load times maintained or improved
3. **Accessibility**: WCAG AA compliance across all new components
4. **Compatibility**: Zero regression in existing functionality
5. **Maintainability**: Clean, testable code following project patterns

### Technical Acceptance

- ✅ All acceptance criteria met across 3 stories
- ✅ Comprehensive test coverage (unit + integration)
- ✅ Cross-browser compatibility (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- ✅ Responsive design validated on mobile/tablet/desktop
- ✅ Performance benchmarks maintained

## Notes for Implementation

### Development Sequence
**Critical Path**: Stories must be completed in order due to dependencies
1. **2.5.1 First** - Icon components are foundation for other stories
2. **2.5.2 Second** - Homepage uses icon components, creates ModeNavigation
3. **2.5.3 Last** - Header integration uses both previous components

### Key Implementation Considerations
- Reference existing Header.tsx theme detection patterns for consistency
- Test icon clarity at smallest size (16px) for header usage  
- Consider preloading critical routes for faster tile navigation
- Maintain existing CSS custom properties for brand colors
- Ensure keyboard accessibility with proper focus indicators

### Asset Optimization Priority
- **High**: Optimize philip.png from 1MB to <100KB target
- **Medium**: Ensure M-logo variants load efficiently
- **Low**: Consider WebP variants for additional optimization

## Ready for Development

**Status**: ✅ **Comprehensive Story Package Complete**

**Total Effort**: 19 story points (1-2 sprint cycles)  
**Risk Level**: Low (brownfield enhancement with clear rollback paths)  
**Dependencies**: All assets available, architecture understood

**Development can begin with Story 2.5.1: Icon Component System & Asset Integration**
