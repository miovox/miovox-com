# Epic 1: Foundational Launch & AI Service Introduction

**Epic Goal:** The goal of this epic is to establish the entire technical foundation of the project and deploy a live, functional website. This initial version will serve as the MVP for the user's primary business line by launching the homepage and a detailed page for the AI Product Development service, allowing for immediate business validation.

## Story 1.1: Project Initialization & Repository Setup

**As a** Developer, **I want** a new project initialized with the chosen framework and a corresponding Git repository, **so that** I have a clean foundation to start building on.
**Acceptance Criteria:**

1.  A new project is created using the Architect's chosen framework (e.g., `npx create-next-app`).
2.  A new Git repository is initialized.
3.  The initial project files are committed to the `main` branch.
4.  A `.gitignore` file is configured with appropriate defaults for the chosen framework.

## Story 1.2: Basic CI/CD Pipeline & Hosting Setup

**As the** Owner, **I want** a basic CI/CD pipeline connected to the repository and a hosting provider, **so that** any push to the main branch is automatically deployed and the site is live.
**Acceptance Criteria:**

1.  A new project is created on the chosen hosting provider (e.g., Vercel, Netlify).
2.  The hosting project is linked to the Git repository.
3.  The CI/CD pipeline automatically deploys the `main` branch on every push.
4.  The default page of the new project is publicly accessible at its provided URL.

## Story 1.3: Homepage Implementation

**As a** Visitor, **I want** to see a homepage that clearly introduces Miovox Studio and directs me to the three core services, **so that** I can understand the brand and choose my path.
