# Epic 3: About, Contact & Launch Readiness (Revised)

**Epic Goal:** The goal of this final epic is to complete the website's core content and functionality. This includes creating a personal connection with visitors through an interactive 'About' page and providing a clear contact method. We will also conduct final polishing and checks to ensure the site is fully ready for its public launch.

## Story 3.1: Interactive About Page Implementation (Revised)

**As a** Visitor, **I want** an interactive 'About' page that showcases the different facets of the owner's expertise, **so that** I can understand the unique, multi-talented person behind Miovox Studio.
**Acceptance Criteria:**

1.  A new `/about` page is created and linked in the site's main navigation or footer.
2.  The page contains a primary photo and a general bio that strongly references and links to `thephilipjones.com`.
3.  The page features an interactive element with the three service areas (e.g., clickable tabs or hoverable links).
4.  Hovering over or clicking a service area dynamically updates a portion of the page to show a specific photo and a short blurb relevant to that service (AI, Home, Events).
5.  The interaction is smooth and the layout remains stable during content changes.
6.  The page is fully responsive.

## Story 3.2: Contact Implementation & Site Footer

**As a** Visitor, **I want** to find contact information easily **so that** I can reach out with a business inquiry.
**Acceptance Criteria:**

1.  The `/about` page prominently features the `mailto:` email link as defined in FR3.
2.  A global site footer is implemented and appears on all pages.
3.  The footer contains copyright information, the business name, and a link to the about/contact page.

## Story 3.3: Final Design Polish & Pre-launch Review

**As the** Owner, **I want** to perform a final review of the entire site to check for consistency, polish, and correctness, **so that** I am confident in the final product before launch.
**Acceptance Criteria:**

1.  All placeholder content across the site is replaced with final copy.
2.  A full site review is conducted to ensure consistent styling, spacing, and typography.
3.  All internal and external links are checked and verified to be working correctly.
4.  The site is reviewed against all high-level UI goals from the PRD.
