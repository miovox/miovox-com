# Story 2.1: Portfolio Component & Data Structure

## Status

Done

## Story

**As the** Owner,
**I want** a reusable portfolio component and a simple data structure,
**so that** I can easily add and display project case studies across the site.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. A data structure (e.g., in a simple JSON or Markdown file) is defined to hold portfolio project information (e.g., title, description, image, service category).
2. A reusable UI component is created that can consume project data and display it in a visually appealing format (e.g., a card or gallery item).
3. The component is designed to be easily embedded on any page and filtered by service category.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Create portfolio data structure and interface (AC: 1)
  - [x] Create TypeScript interface file at `/src/data/types.ts` for PortfolioProject interface
  - [x] Create data file at `/src/data/portfolio.ts` with sample portfolio projects
  - [x] Include projects for each service category: "Product", "Home", "Event"
  - [x] Follow data model specification from architecture docs exactly
- [x] Implement reusable PortfolioGallery component (AC: 2, 3)
  - [x] Create component at `/src/components/features/PortfolioGallery.tsx`
  - [x] Implement filtering functionality by service category
  - [x] Design visually appealing card layout using Tailwind CSS
  - [x] Ensure component is fully responsive following mobile-first approach
  - [x] Add proper TypeScript typing for all props and state
- [x] Add unit tests for portfolio functionality
  - [x] Create test file at `/src/components/features/PortfolioGallery.test.tsx`
  - [x] Test component rendering with different data sets
  - [x] Test category filtering functionality
  - [x] Test responsive behavior and accessibility
  - [x] Use Vitest and React Testing Library per testing strategy
- [x] Create data utilities and helper functions
  - [x] Implement filtering functions for category-based queries
  - [x] Add date sorting functionality for project display order
  - [x] Export utility functions for use across components

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

From Story 1.4 completion:

- All existing components use functional React components with TypeScript strict typing
- Tailwind CSS utility classes are used exclusively for styling
- Testing framework (Vitest + React Testing Library) is configured and operational
- Components follow mobile-first responsive design patterns
- Project structure follows Next.js App Router conventions

### Architecture Foundation

**Framework and Language:** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

- Next.js ~14.2 with App Router for file-system based routing
- TypeScript ~5.4 with strict typing (no `any` types allowed)
- React ~18.2 functional components with hooks for state management
- Styling exclusively with Tailwind CSS ~3.4 utility classes

**Component Architecture:** [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md]

- Functional components using React and TypeScript
- Standard `/src` layout with `/app` (routes), `/components` (ui, shared, features), `/data`, `/styles`
- State management with built-in React Hooks (useState, useContext)
- All data for MVP imported directly from local TypeScript files

### Data Models

**Portfolio Project Interface:** [Source: architecture/data-models.md]

```typescript
interface PortfolioProject {
  slug: string;
  title: string;
  date: string; // For sorting, in "YYYY-MM-DD" format
  shortDescription: string; // For the card view on the service page
  imageUrl: string; // The main "thumbnail" or "cover" image
  galleryImageUrls?: string[]; // (optional): For a gallery inside the modal
  content: string; // Detailed content for the modal, written in Markdown
  category: "Product" | "Home" | "Event";
  isFeatured?: boolean; // (optional): To pin a project to the top of the list
}
```

**Data Storage Strategy:** [Source: architecture/data-models.md]

- MVP uses file-based data source in `/data/portfolio.ts`
- Interface designed for future CMS compatibility
- Data imported directly from local TypeScript files per frontend services layer

### Component Specifications

**PortfolioGallery Component:** [Source: architecture/components.md]

- Feature component that displays filtered grid of portfolio projects on service pages
- Must be easily embeddable on any page with category filtering
- Visually appealing card format for project display
- Should integrate with planned PortfolioDetailModal for future stories

**Card Component:** [Source: architecture/components.md]

- Generic, reusable component providing base style for service and portfolio cards
- Should be used as foundation for portfolio project cards

### File Locations

**Project Structure:** [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]

- Data files: `/src/data/` directory (portfolio.ts, types.ts)
- Feature components: `/src/components/features/` (PortfolioGallery.tsx)
- Test files: Located alongside components (PortfolioGallery.test.tsx)

### Technical Constraints

**Coding Standards:** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]

- Strict TypeScript with no `any` types
- Styling exclusively with Tailwind CSS
- Centralized data access
- Safe environment variable handling

**State Management:** [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md]

- Use built-in React Hooks (useState, useContext) only
- Maintain simplicity for MVP scope
- No external state management libraries

### Testing Requirements

**Testing Strategy:** [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]

- Unit/Integration tests using Vitest ~1.5 and React Testing Library
- Test files located alongside components
- Focus on component rendering, functionality, and responsive behavior
- Testing Pyramid approach with solid unit test foundation

**Specific Test Cases:**

- Component renders without errors with sample data
- Filtering by category works correctly for all service types
- Card layout displays project information properly
- Responsive design functions across breakpoints
- Component handles empty data sets gracefully
- Accessibility standards are met
