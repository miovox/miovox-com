## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

From Story 2.2 completion:

- PortfolioGallery component is fully implemented and tested at `/src/components/features/PortfolioGallery.tsx`
- Component supports category filtering via props and displays in responsive card grid
- Portfolio data structure includes 2 existing "Home" category projects in `/src/data/portfolio.ts`
- Page pattern established in `/src/app/product/page.tsx` with MainLayout, Container, and semantic HTML structure
- Testing patterns established using Vitest and React Testing Library

### Architecture Foundation

**Framework and Language:** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

- Next.js ~14.2 with App Router for file-system based routing
- TypeScript ~5.4 with strict typing (no `any` types allowed)
- React ~18.2 functional components with hooks for state management
- Styling exclusively with Tailwind CSS ~3.4 utility classes

**Component Architecture:** [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md]

- Functional components using React and TypeScript
- Standard `/src` layout with `/app` (routes), `/components` (ui, shared, features), `/data`, `/styles`
- State management with built-in React Hooks (useState, useContext)
- All data for MVP imported directly from local TypeScript files

### Data Models

**Portfolio Project Interface:** [Source: architecture/data-models.md]

```typescript
interface PortfolioProject {
  slug: string;
  title: string;
  date: string; // For sorting, in "YYYY-MM-DD" format
  shortDescription: string; // For the card view on the service page
  imageUrl: string; // The main "thumbnail" or "cover" image
  galleryImageUrls?: string[]; // (optional): For a gallery inside the modal
  content: string; // Detailed content for the modal, written in Markdown
  category: "Product" | "Home" | "Event";
  isFeatured?: boolean; // (optional): To pin a project to the top of the list
}
```

**Existing Home Category Data:** [Source: /src/data/portfolio.ts]

- Portfolio data already contains 2 Home category projects: "Intelligent Lighting Automation" and "Advanced Home Security System"
- Projects include all required fields and proper category assignment
- Data filtering utilities available: `getProjectsByCategory("Home")` and `getSortedProjects("Home")`

### Component Specifications

**PortfolioGallery Component:** [Source: architecture/components.md]

- Feature component that displays filtered grid of portfolio projects on service pages
- Must be easily embeddable on any page with category filtering
- Visually appealing card format for project display
- Should integrate with planned PortfolioDetailModal for future stories

**Component Usage Pattern:**
From analysis of existing implementations:

```typescript
<PortfolioGallery category="Home" showFilters={false} />
```

**BrandPortal Navigation Update:** [Source: /src/components/features/BrandPortal.tsx]

- Currently uses href="#" for Home Tech Solutions link (line 37)
- Needs update to href="/home" to enable navigation
- Maintain existing styling, hover effects, and responsive behavior

### File Locations

**Project Structure:** [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]

- New page: `/src/app/home/page.tsx` (follows Next.js App Router pattern)
- Test file: `/src/app/home/page.test.tsx` (alongside page component)
- Navigation update: `/src/components/features/BrandPortal.tsx`
- Data files: `/src/data/portfolio.ts` (existing data structure)
- Feature components: `/src/components/features/PortfolioGallery.tsx` (existing component)

### Technical Constraints

**Coding Standards:** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]

- Strict TypeScript with no `any` types
- Styling exclusively with Tailwind CSS
- Centralized data access
- Safe environment variable handling

**State Management:** [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md]

- Use built-in React Hooks (useState, useContext) only
- Maintain simplicity for MVP scope
- No external state management libraries

### Testing Requirements

**Testing Strategy:** [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]

- Unit/Integration tests using Vitest ~1.5 and React Testing Library
- Test files located alongside components and pages
- Focus on component rendering, functionality, and responsive behavior
- Testing Pyramid approach with solid unit test foundation

**Specific Test Cases:**

- Home page renders without errors
- PortfolioGallery component appears on the home page
- Only "Home" category projects are displayed in the gallery
- Page maintains proper responsive layout and existing functionality
- Component handles Home category data correctly
- Page metadata and SEO elements are properly configured
- Navigation link from homepage works correctly

### Service Content Guidelines

Based on existing BrandPortal content:

- Main title: "Home Tech Solutions"
- Subtitle: "Crafting Lifestyles"
- Description: "Transforming your home with expertly designed technology systems that enhance daily life."
- Focus on smart home automation, energy efficiency, and lifestyle enhancement
- Portfolio section title: "Featured Home Tech Projects"

## Testing

**Test Framework:** Vitest ~1.5 and React Testing Library [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]

**Testing Standards:**

- Focus on component rendering and integration testing
- Test portfolio filtering works correctly for "Home" category
- Verify responsive design and accessibility
- Ensure page metadata and navigation functionality
- Follow Testing Pyramid approach with comprehensive unit test coverage
