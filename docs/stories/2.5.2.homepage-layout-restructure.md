# Story 2.5.2: Homepage Layout Restructure

## Status

Approved

## Story

**As a** website visitor,
**I want** the homepage to display service navigation as a 1×4 grid in the bottom section,
**so that** I can quickly access different areas of the site without needing to scroll.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Layout Restructure**

   - Hero section (logo + tagline) occupying top 70% of viewport
   - 4-tile navigation grid occupying bottom 30% of viewport (30vh)
   - No scroll required to see all content on standard desktop screens (1920x1080, 1440x900)
   - Grid arranged as 1×4 layout (desktop) with equal spacing
   - Each tile taking exactly 25% of viewport width

2. **ServiceNavigation Component - Homepage Variant**

   - Each tile displays appropriate ServiceIcon (Products/Events/Home Tech/About)
   - Service name as primary text (Products, Events, Home Tech, About)
   - Tagline as secondary text (Crafting Tools, Crafting Memories, Crafting Lifestyles, It's This Guy)
   - Full-bleed background media support with gradient overlays
   - Sophisticated hover transitions with scale effect and background intensity change

3. **Responsive Behavior**

   - **Desktop (≥1025px)**: 1×4 grid, 30vh height, full text labels
   - **Tablet (641px-1024px)**: 2×2 grid, 35vh height, responsive text sizing
   - **Mobile (≤640px)**: 2×2 grid, 40vh height, reduced padding/text, touch-friendly targets (≥44px)

4. **Hero Section Modifications**

   - Remove all scroll-dependent animations and behaviors
   - Center logo and tagline vertically within its 70vh container
   - Maintain existing logo sizing and typography
   - Remove the animated down arrow and "Studios" text
   - Keep the dark background theme
   - Ensure content doesn't overflow into navigation grid area

5. **Navigation Integration**
   - Navigate to correct route (Products → /product, Events → /events, Home Tech → /home, About → /about)
   - Maintain existing page functionality after navigation
   - Provide visual feedback during hover and click states
   - Support keyboard navigation for accessibility
   - Include proper ARIA labels and roles

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

From Story 2.5.1 completion:

- ServiceIcon component available with all service variants (products, events, home-tech, about)
- Theme-aware icon system working seamlessly with existing theme switching
- Size variants from small (16px) to xxlarge (64px) implemented
- Testing patterns established with Vitest and React Testing Library

From Story 2.4 completion:

- Existing routing structure (/product, /events, /home) working perfectly
- PortfolioGallery component patterns established for service pages
- Page structure and responsive design patterns validated
- Next.js Link component navigation established

### Component Architecture

[Source: architecture/components.md#4-feature-components]

- **`ServiceNavigation`**: Single unified component with variant-based rendering:
  - **Homepage variant** (`variant="homepage"`): 1×4 desktop grid (2×2 mobile) with rich visual tiles
  - **Header variant** (`variant="header"`): Subtle inline dropdown (Story 2.5.3)
- **`ServiceCard`**: Individual homepage navigation tile with rich background media support

### Service Configuration

[Source: docs/handoff/brand-portal-modes-final-specification.md#service-configuration]
Service definitions centralized in `/src/data/services.ts`:

```typescript
const services: ServiceConfig[] = [
  {
    id: "product",
    label: "Products",
    tagline: "Crafting Tools",
    brandStatement: "Miovox Products",
    href: "/product",
    icon: "products",
    bgColor: "miovox-blue-50",
    hoverColor: "miovox-blue-100",
    backgroundMedia: {
      type: "image",
      src: "/backgrounds/products-bg.jpg",
      overlay: "gradient",
    },
  },
  // ... additional services
];
```

### Design Specifications

[Source: docs/handoff/brand-portal-modes-final-specification.md#design-specifications]

#### Homepage 1×4 Grid Layout

```css
/* Grid Container */
.homepage-grid {
  height: 30vh;
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(4, 1fr);
  grid-template-rows: 1fr;
  gap: 0; /* Tiles touch each other */
}

/* Individual Tiles */
.service-tile {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
  padding: 2rem;
  transition: transform 0.3s ease-out, background-color 0.3s ease-out,
    box-shadow 0.3s ease-out;
}

.service-tile:hover {
  transform: scale(1.02);
  box-shadow: 0 8px 25px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15);
  z-index: 10;
}
```

#### Typography Scale

```css
/* Desktop */
.service-label {
  font-size: 3rem; /* text-5xl */
  font-weight: 700;
  line-height: 1.2;
}

.service-tagline {
  font-size: 1.25rem; /* text-xl */
  opacity: 0.9;
  color: muted-foreground;
}

/* Mobile */
@media (max-width: 640px) {
  .service-label {
    font-size: 1.5rem;
  } /* text-2xl */
  .service-tagline {
    font-size: 1rem;
  } /* text-base */
}
```

```

### Technical Constraints

[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]

- Strict TypeScript with no `any` types allowed
- Styling exclusively with Tailwind CSS utility classes
- Centralized data access patterns
- Safe environment variable handling

[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

- Next.js ~14.2 with App Router for file-system based routing
- React ~18.2 functional components with hooks for state management
- Tailwind CSS ~3.4 utility-first framework

### State Management Architecture

[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#state-management-architecture]

- State managed exclusively with built-in React Hooks (`useState`, `useContext`, `useTheme`, `usePathname`)
- **Service Navigation State**: Uses service configuration from centralized data file
- **Background Media**: ServiceCard components support full-bleed images, textures, or videos with overlay gradients
- **Responsive Icon Scaling**: ServiceIcon automatically scales based on viewport and context

### Component Interfaces

```typescript
interface ServiceNavigationProps {
  variant: "homepage" | "header";
  className?: string;
}

interface ServiceCardProps {
  service: ServiceConfig;
  size?: "standard" | "large";
  className?: string;
}

interface ServiceConfig {
  id: "product" | "events" | "home" | "about";
  label: string;
  tagline: string;
  href: string;
  icon: ServiceType;
  bgColor: string;
  hoverColor: string;
  backgroundMedia?: {
    type: "image" | "texture" | "video";
    src: string;
    overlay: "gradient" | "solid";
  };
}
```

### Performance Requirements

[Source: docs/handoff/brand-portal-modes-final-specification.md#performance-focus]

- **60fps animations**: Transform/opacity only, no layout shifts
- **Optimized assets**: WebP variants, proper Next.js Image usage
- **Accessibility first**: WCAG AA compliance, keyboard navigation, screen readers

### Responsive Strategy

[Source: docs/handoff/brand-portal-modes-final-specification.md#responsive-strategy]

- **Desktop (≥1025px)**: 1×4 horizontal grid for optimal scanning
- **Tablet (641px-1024px)**: 2×2 grid with responsive text sizing
- **Mobile (≤640px)**: 2×2 grid with touch-optimized targets (44px+)

### Color System

[Source: docs/handoff/brand-portal-modes-final-specification.md#color-system]

```css
:root {
  --miovox-blue-50: #f0f9ff; /* Products */
  --miovox-blue-100: #e0f2fe; /* Events */
  --miovox-blue-200: #bae6fd; /* Home Tech */
  --miovox-blue-300: #7dd3fc; /* About */
  --miovox-blue-400: #38bdf8; /* Hover states */
}
```

### Testing Requirements

[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
Testing follows the Testing Pyramid with Unit/Integration tests using **Vitest ~1.5** and **React Testing Library**:

Test file structure:

```
src/components/features/
├── ServiceNavigation.tsx
├── ServiceNavigation.test.tsx
├── ServiceCard.tsx (sub-component)
└── ServiceCard.test.tsx

src/app/
├── page.tsx
└── page.test.tsx
```

Specific test cases to implement:

- Homepage renders without scroll on desktop (1920x1080, 1440x900)
- 4-tile grid displays correctly across responsive breakpoints
- Navigation from tiles works to all routes (/product, /events, /home, /about)
- Hero section centers properly without scroll behavior
- Hover states and animations work smoothly
- Touch targets meet accessibility requirements (≥44px)
- Background media loads correctly with gradient overlays
- Keyboard navigation works for all service tiles

### Dependencies

- ✅ Story 2.5.1 (ServiceIcon Component) must be completed first
- ✅ Existing routing structure remains unchanged (/product, /events, /home)
- ✅ Color system (miovox-blue-\* classes) available in Tailwind config
- ⚠️ About page route needs to exist (handled in Story 2.5.3)
- ⚠️ Background media assets need to be created (can use placeholders initially)
