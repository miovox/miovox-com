# Goals and Background Context

## Goals

- Establish a professional web presence for the "Miovox Studio" brand.
- Create a credible touchpoint to validate the business for pre-existing leads.
- Clearly communicate the three core service offerings: AI Product Development, Home Tech Solutions, and Event Memories.
- Build the site as a portfolio piece showcasing modern, AI-driven development capabilities.

## Background Context

Miovox LLC is a new, single-owner business created to unify three distinct service lines under the brand "Miovox Studio." The primary challenge is to create a single brand identity that cohesively represents these disparate offerings. The website's main purpose is not new lead generation, but to serve as a professional validation point for potential clients who have already been contacted. The project operates under tight budget and time constraints, leveraging AI-driven development for efficiency.
