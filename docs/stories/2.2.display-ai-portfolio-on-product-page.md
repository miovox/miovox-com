## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

From Story 2.1 completion:

- PortfolioGallery component is fully implemented and tested at `/src/components/features/PortfolioGallery.tsx`
- Portfolio data structure and utilities are established in `/src/data/portfolio.ts` and `/src/data/types.ts`
- Component supports category filtering via props and displays in responsive card grid
- All utility functions for data filtering and sorting are available and tested
- Component follows strict TypeScript typing and Tailwind CSS styling standards

### Architecture Foundation

**Framework and Language:** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

- Next.js ~14.2 with App Router for file-system based routing
- TypeScript ~5.4 with strict typing (no `any` types allowed)
- React ~18.2 functional components with hooks for state management
- Styling exclusively with Tailwind CSS ~3.4 utility classes

**Component Architecture:** [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md]

- Functional components using React and TypeScript
- Standard `/src` layout with `/app` (routes), `/components` (ui, shared, features), `/data`, `/styles`
- State management with built-in React Hooks (useState, useContext)
- All data for MVP imported directly from local TypeScript files

### Data Models

**Portfolio Project Interface:** [Source: architecture/data-models.md]

```typescript
interface PortfolioProject {
  slug: string;
  title: string;
  date: string; // For sorting, in "YYYY-MM-DD" format
  shortDescription: string; // For the card view on the service page
  imageUrl: string; // The main "thumbnail" or "cover" image
  galleryImageUrls?: string[]; // (optional): For a gallery inside the modal
  content: string; // Detailed content for the modal, written in Markdown
  category: "Product" | "Home" | "Event";
  isFeatured?: boolean; // (optional): To pin a project to the top of the list
}
```

**Data Storage Strategy:** [Source: architecture/data-models.md]

- MVP uses file-based data source in `/src/data/portfolio.ts`
- Interface designed for future CMS compatibility
- Data imported directly from local TypeScript files per frontend services layer

### Component Specifications

**PortfolioGallery Component:** [Source: architecture/components.md]

- Feature component that displays filtered grid of portfolio projects on service pages
- Must be easily embeddable on any page with category filtering
- Visually appealing card format for project display
- Should integrate with planned PortfolioDetailModal for future stories

**Existing Component Usage Pattern:**

From analysis of 2.1 implementation, the component accepts category filter prop:

```typescript
<PortfolioGallery category="Product" />
```

### File Locations

**Project Structure:** [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]

- Data files: `/src/data/` directory (portfolio.ts, types.ts)
- Page components: `/src/app/product/` (page.tsx, page.test.tsx)
- Feature components: `/src/components/features/` (PortfolioGallery.tsx)
- Test files: Located alongside components and pages

### Technical Constraints

**Coding Standards:** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]

- Strict TypeScript with no `any` types
- Styling exclusively with Tailwind CSS
- Centralized data access
- Safe environment variable handling

**State Management:** [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md]

- Use built-in React Hooks (useState, useContext) only
- Maintain simplicity for MVP scope
- No external state management libraries

### Testing Requirements

**Testing Strategy:** [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]

- Unit/Integration tests using Vitest ~1.5 and React Testing Library
- Test files located alongside components and pages
- Focus on component rendering, functionality, and responsive behavior
- Testing Pyramid approach with solid unit test foundation

**Specific Test Cases:**

- Product page renders without errors
- PortfolioGallery component appears on the product page
- Only "Product" category projects are displayed in the gallery
- Page maintains proper responsive layout and existing functionality
- Component handles empty Product category data gracefully
- Page metadata and SEO elements remain intact

### Current Product Page State

**Existing Implementation:** [Source: /src/app/product/page.tsx]

- Page exists with proper metadata, layout structure, and responsive design
- Currently shows "Coming Soon" placeholder in aside section
- Uses MainLayout and Container components following established patterns
- Placeholder section is located in `<aside className="max-w-4xl mx-auto mt-12">`
- This placeholder should be replaced with the PortfolioGallery component

## Testing

**Test Framework:** Vitest ~1.5 and React Testing Library [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
**Test Location:** Tests alongside components in `/src/app/product/page.test.tsx`
**Testing Standards:**

- Focus on component rendering and integration testing
- Test portfolio filtering works correctly for "Product" category
- Verify responsive design and accessibility
- Ensure existing page functionality remains intact
- Follow Testing Pyramid approach with comprehensive unit test coverage
